Hubstaff is a time tracking and workforce management platform that automates many aspects of running a growing business. Teams can track time to projects and to-dos using Hubstaff's desktop, web, or mobile applications.Hubstaff is a software as a service (SaaS) provider with three main divisions: Hubstaff, which provides invoicing, reporting, payments, and related services; Hubstaff Tasks, for project management; and Hubstaff Talent, to post jobs and remotely hire employees.

For Hubstaff to work, however, its service must be installed on employee computers and devices. If companies allow employees to use their own equipment, many of Hubstaff’s employee-monitoring and time-tracking tools can’t be used. Hubstaff works with iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac, which means it compatible with most devices employees use. Link: https://app.hubstaff.com/
